# ðŸ’³ FinanKu Credit Card Late Payment Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
There is a concern about late credit card payments at **FinanKu**, which can negatively impact the business.  
Therefore, it is necessary to predict customers with a high risk of late payment in order to design appropriate strategies to mitigate future risks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build a machine learning model that can predict **at least 60%** of customers who are likely to be late in credit card payments  
(Target: **Accuracy & Recall above 60%**).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset & Variables
The dataset consists of customer information with the following variables:

1. **Customer ID**: Unique customer identifier  
2. **Branch**: Customer branch location  
3. **City**: Customer city location  
4. **Age**: Customerâ€™s age during the observation period  
5. **Avg. Annual Income/Month**: Average monthly income in one year  
6. **Balance (Q1â€“Q4)**: Quarter-end balance  
7. **Num of Products (Q1â€“Q4)**: Number of products owned at quarter-end  
8. **HasCrCard (Q1â€“Q4)**: Credit card ownership status  
9. **Active Member (Q1â€“Q4)**: Membership activity status  
10. **Unpaid Tagging**: Customer default (late payment) status  

## ðŸ”¬ Experiment Setup
- **Observation Period**:  
  - Last 12 months  
  - Last 6 months  

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Average balance across observation horizon, and balance change between start & end period  
  - Product ownership: average, max, and min  
  - Active membership calculated in months  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** â†’ Data cleaning, preprocessing, modeling  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** â†’ Feature engineering & machine learning  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â†’ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Classification Models** â†’ Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest  

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcome
- A predictive model with **Accuracy & Recall > 60%**  
- Identification of key factors influencing late payments  
- Insights to support business decision-making for credit risk management
